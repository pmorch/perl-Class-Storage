=head1 NAME

Class::Unbless - unbless classes so they are rebless-able later.

Handles blessed HASHes and ARRAYs

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

B<NOTE>: I<THE NAME OF THIS CLASS MAY CHANGE. I'M LOOKING FOR OPINIONS ON
THAT.>

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module came into existence out of the need to be able to send I<objects>
over JSON. JSON does not allow any blessed references to be sent by default and
if sent, provides no generic way to resurrect these objects again after
decoding. This can now all be done like this:

    use JSON;
    use Class::Unbless qw(unbless rebless);

    my $object = MyModule->new();
    my $jsonString = encode_json(unbless $object);

    print $writeHandle $jsonString, "\n";

    # And on the other "side":

    my $jsonString = <$readHandle>;
    my $object2 = rebless(decode_json($jsonString));

However, there is no JSON-specific functionality in this module whatsoever,
only a way to cleanly "unbless" - remove the bless-ing - in a way that reliably
can be re-introduced later.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Using a magic string

As you can see from the L</"SYNOPSIS">, we use a magic string ("__class__" by default) to store the class information for HASHes and ARRAYs.

So:

    bless { key => "value" }, "ModuleA";
    bless [ "val1", "val2" ], "ModuleB";

become:

    { __class__ => 'ModuleA', key => "value" }
    [ "__class__", 'ModuleB', "val1", "val2" ]

Any hashes with the magic string as a key and any arrays with the magic string
as the first element will be converted to blessed references

This "magic string" can be given as an option (see L</"OPTIONS">), but if you
cannot live with a magic string, you can also provide
C<< magicString => undef >>

But then you won't be able to rebless that data. If this is your itch, you may
actually want L<Data::Structure::Util> instead.

=head3 Returns unbless-ed/rebless-ed data + modifies input argument

The valid data is returned. However, for speed, we also modify and re-use data
from the input value. So don't rely on being able to reuse the C<$data> input
for C<bless> and C<unbless> after they've been called and don't modify them
either.

If you don't want your input modified:

    use Storable qw(dclone);
    my $pristineData = somesub();
    my $unblessed = ubless(dclone($pristineData));

=head2 Inspiration

Class::Unbless is inspired by L<MooseX::Storage> but this is a generic
implementation that works on all plain perl classes that are implemented as
blessed references to HASHes and ARRAYs (B<only> hashes and arrays).

    use Class::Unbless qw(unbless rebless);

    my $unblesed = unbless( bless { a => 1 }, 'MyModule' );

    # $unblessed is now { __class__ => 'MyModule', a => 1 }

    my $reblessed = rebless($unblessed);

    # $reblessed is now bless { a => 1 }, 'MyModule'

NOTE: L<MooseX::Storage> uses C<__CLASS__> as its magic string and we use
C<__class__> to make sure they're not the same.

=head1 NOTE ABOUT KINDS OF BLESSED OBJECTS

L<perlobj> says:

"... it's possible to bless any type of data structure or referent, including
scalars, globs, and subroutines. You may see this sort of thing when looking at
code in the wild."

In particular I've seen several XS modules create instances where the internal
state is not visible to Perl, and hence cannot be handled properly by this
module. Here is an example with JSON:

    use Data::Dumper;
    use JSON;
    print Dumper(JSON->new()->pretty(1));
    # prints
    # $VAR1 = bless( do{\(my $o = '')}, 'JSON' );

Clearly a L<JSON> object has internal state and other data. This is an example
of a blessed reference, but not a blessed HASH or ARRAY that Class::Unbless can
handle. If you try C<unbless>-ing such a JSON instance, Class::Unbless will
just leave the JSON object altogether untouched.

=head1 EXPORT

    our @EXPORT_OK = qw(unbless rebless);

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

Both C<unbless> and C<bless> share the same C<%options>. See L</"OPTIONS">
below.

=head2 unbless

    my $unblessed = unbless($blessed, %options);

=head2 rebless

    my $reblessed = rebless($unbessed, %options);

=head1 OPTIONS

These options are common to C<unbless> and C<rebless>:

=over 4

=item * C<toUnblessedMethodName>

This option lets you change the name of the C<TO_UNBLESSED> method to something
else. Hint: C<TO_JSON> could be a good idea here!

=item * C<toBlessedMethodName>

This option lets you change the name of the C<TO_BLESSED> method to something
else. Hint: C<FROM_JSON> could be a good idea here, even though L<JSON>
doesn't have such a method.

Which is actually the entire Raison d'Etre of this module!

=item * C<magicString>

Change the magic string used to store the class name to something else than
C<__class__>.

If this is false, don't store class information at all, in which case
C<unbless> becomes analogous to L<Data::Structure::Util::unbless>.
